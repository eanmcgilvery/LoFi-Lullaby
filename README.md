# LoFi-Lullaby

Lo-Fi Lullaby is a 3D game made in Unity, utlizing scripts in C# to control game interactions and functions. I created this alongside
3 other team memebers at HackTech, a 36 hour hackathon. I primarely worked on the User Interface, as well as controls for the Player object. One other member worked directly on the game with me, while the other two worked upon creating a local website to host the game on.

LoFi Lullaby captures the calming, care-free essence of LoFi in an equally tranquil and
stress-free environment. Traverse endless rolling hills with your pal, Rudy and admire 
the stunning landscape flush with nature, but don't get too close!

This was our team's first hackathon and therefore, we started from scratch with no knowledge of how to do anything. Working with 3 strangers and learning each other's strengths provided an early challenge. Setting a realistic goal based our limited abilities and time frame. 30+ sleepless hours of tutorial videos and hair pulling later, we are proud of our product!

Our plans to continue with the game include:
  -Hosting the game on a website that can be accessed worldwide.
  -Eliminating the possibility to spawn above terrain, thus ending the game prematurely.
  -Adding a high score feature on the main menu.
  -Ability to choose from multiple characters and backgrounds
