# LoFi-Lullaby
Repository for the code I made at HackTech 2019. Written in C#



LoFi Lullaby captures the calming, care-free essence of LoFi in an equally tranquil and
stress-free environment. Traverse endless rolling hills with your pal, Rudy and admire 
the stunning landscape flush with nature, but don't get too close!
